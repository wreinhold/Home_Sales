# Home_Sales

In this assignment for my Data Science Bootcamp, I was tasked to perform a series of queries using Spark SQL. In the home_sales.ipynb file, you can find my code that searches through the given data set to answer various questions. I also create temporary views, cache and uncache tables, and partition formatted parquet data.
